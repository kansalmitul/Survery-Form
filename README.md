# Survey Form
This repo contains a Web Survey form project developed by me. The project code is written in PHP, HTML5, CSS and SQL. User enters his details in the Survey form and when he/she clicks over the 'Submit' button, the data entered by the user gets stored into the localhost MySQL database.
